   When the home values are depreciating, banks may freeze the secured HELOC.
   
2) Based on variable prime rate. So risky because of interest rate may increase based on inflation.
3) Hard to get HELOC on the investment property or the property that you are not living in.


Advantages

2) Eligible forms of down payment.

   Also if you can find another debt weapon to pay off 40K in HELOC you have again full 50K available.
4) HELOC has tax benefits.
